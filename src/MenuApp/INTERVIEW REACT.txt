Shubham Madheysia EASY REACT MOCK

Open https://codesandbox.io/s/new and create a new React component with 2 input fields, input1 and input2. Users can type any number in either of these input fields. You need to ensure that (input2 minus input1) is equal to 1 always. Means if user type value 5 in input1 then input2 value should change to 6 (to make input2 - input1 = 1). And similarly, if input2 value is 100 then input1 value should change to 99. You need to just play around with input values

Note: In the UI only 2 input fields should be present. No button needed.

Problem 2: Optimize ‘Problem 1’ by making it a stateless component. Means solve problem 1 without using any state variable. You still need to play with input tags and values only.

Note: Don’t write vanilla JS like document.getElementById etc. Use react hooks here.

PS: Keep Problem 1 and Problem 2 solutions separately. Don’t just work on Problem 2 because it is an optimization of Problem 1. Start with 1st alone

Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state.
What happens when there is a network error? 
Do I really need to hit my server every time my user visits the home page 
if the data hasn’t changed?
URL state	React Router ,useHistory or useLocation,useParams
information we need about our location, history, and pathname.
Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters.


React componenets
Components are independent and reusable bits of code.

Four Kinds of React State
Local state	useState,useReducer
Global state	Context API,Redux 
manage state across multiple components,
Server state	useSWR



Three phases
Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

Mounting
constructor(),getDerivedStateFromProps(),render(),componentDidMount()

Updating
getDerivedStateFromProps(),shouldComponentUpdate(),render(),
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(),componentDidUpdate()

Unmounting
componentWillUnmount()


Hooks
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other 
React features without writing class
Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional

useState
useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component
useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:
The current state.
A function that updates the state.



useEffect
useEffect lets us perform side effects in function components
It runs once our component mounts.The Effect Hook allows us to perform side 
effects (an action) in the function components.Effects Hooks are equivalent to 
componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount() 
Two types of side-effects:
Effects Without Cleanup
Effects With Cleanup,React performs the cleanup of memory when the 
component unmounts.Effects run for every render method and not just once. 
Therefore, React also cleans up effects from the previous render 
before running the effects next time.

useContext
Context provides a way to pass data or state through the component tree 
without having to pass props down manually through each nested component. 
It is designed to share data that can be considered as global data for a 
tree of React components.
const authContext = useContext(initialValue);
The useContext accepts the value provided by React.createContext and 
then re-render the component whenever its value changes

Context API/ Redux
The main purpose of Redux is to have a central repository of all 
the states in the app

import React from 'react';
 
// Creating the context object and passing the default values.
const authContext = React.createContext({status:null,login:()=>{}});
 
export default authContext;


import React, { useState } from "react";
import Auth from "./Auth";
import AuthContext from "./auth-context";
 
const App = () => {
  //using the state to dynamicallly pass the values to the context
 
  const [authstatus, setauthstatus] = useState(false);
  const login = () => {
    setauthstatus(true);
  };
  return (
    <>
      <AuthContext.Provider value={{ status: authstatus, login: login }}>
        <Auth />
      </AuthContext.Provider>
    </>
  );
};
export default App;


import React, { useContext } from "react";
import AuthContext from "./auth-context";
 
const Auth = () => {
  // Now all the data stored in the context can
  // be accessed with the auth variable
  const auth = useContext(AuthContext);
  console.log(auth.status);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Are you authenticated?</h1>
      {auth.status }
	<p>Yes you are</p>
    </div>
   )
}


To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as "props" 
through each nested component. This is called "prop drilling".
React developers often encounter scenarios where they must 
pass data/state from a top-level component to a deeply nested component. 
Prop drilling refers to transporting this data/state as props to the intended destination through intermediate components.


useMemo allows us to 'memoize', or remember the result of expensive calculations 
const ans=useMemo(() => getLetterCount(word), [word])

useRef
allow us to create a reference to a given element / component when the component mounts

useReducer
Reducers are simple, predictable (pure) functions that take a previous state object 
and an action object and return a new state object

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "LOGIN":
      return { username: action.payload.username, isAuth: true };
    case "SIGNOUT":
      // could also spread in initialState here
      return { username: "", isAuth: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function App(){
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  function handleLogin() {
    dispatch({ type: "LOGIN", payload: { username: "Ted" } });
  }

  function handleSignout() {
    dispatch({ type: "SIGNOUT" });
  }

  return (
    <>
      Current user: {state.username}, isAuthenticated: {state.isAuth}
      <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
      <button onClick={handleSignout}>Signout</button>
    </>
  );
}


What is React
React is a JavaScript library, not a framework.

featues
JSX
components	create reusable behavior
React takes care of updating our UI when our data changes, 
without the need to update the DOM manually ourselves


pass data to React components
Props
Context API


React Fragments
React that let you write group children elements or components without 
creating an actual node in the DOM.


useCallback is to prevent functions that are declared within the body of function 
components from being recreated on every render.
useMemo, on the other hand, memoizes an expensive operation that we give it.


Higher order Component
higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.


fetch and axios
  const fetchData = () => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
      .then(response => {
        return response.json()
      })
      .then(data => {
        setUsers(data)
      })
  }

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
    const data = await response.json()
    setUsers(data)
  }


  const fetchData = () => {
    axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users").then(response => {
      setUsers(response.data)
    })
  }

    const postings = async () => {
        try{
            const res = await axios.get(url)
            setPosts(res.data.data)
        } catch (error) {
            console.log('error')
        }
    }

    const fetchData = async () => {
      const result = await axios(
        'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=redux',
      );
 
      setData(result.data);
    };


HOC
https://www.codingdeft.com/posts/react-fetch-data-api/


ROUTERS
Memory Router
Memory router keeps the URL changes in memory not in the user browsers. 
it does not read or write to the address bar so the user can not use the 
browser’s back button as well as the forward button

Browser Router
It routes as a normal URL in the browser and assumes that the server is handling 
all the request URL

Hash Router
Hash router uses client-side hash routing. 
It uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI 
in sync with the URLWhenever, there is a new route get rendered, it updated 
the browser URL with hash routes.


Pure Component
Pure Component, there is no need for shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method. 
ReactJS Pure Component Class compares current state and props with new props 
and states to decide whether the React component should re-render itself or  Not.
Pure components
Its return value is only determined by its input values
Its return value is always the same for the same input values
If you want React to treat a functional component as a pure component, 
you’ll have to convert the functional component to a class component 
that extends React.PureComponent


React.memo()

React.PureComponent for class components and React.
memo() for function components.
The PureComponent and memo() use the default implementation of, 
shouldComponentUpdate() with a shallow prop and state comparison. 
So, a pure component is a component that only re-renders if props/state 
is different from the previous props and state.



React memo
export default memo(Todos);
Now the Todos component only re-renders when the todos that are passed 
to it through props are updated.


HOC:Components take one or more components as arguments, and return a new 
upgraded component.
We don’t modify or mutate components. We create new ones.
A HOC is used to compose components for code reuse.
A HOC is a pure function. It has no side effects, returning only a new component.

import React from 'react';
function WithLoading(Component) {
  return function WihLoadingComponent({ isLoading, ...props }) {
    if (!isLoading) return <Component {...props} />;
    return <p>Hold on, fetching data might take some time.</p>;
  };
}
export default WithLoading;

import React from 'react';
import List from './components/List.js';
import WithLoading from './components/withLoading.js';
const ListWithLoading = WithLoading(List);

const App=()=>{

  render() {
    return (
      <ListWithLoading
        isLoading={this.state.loading}
        repos={this.state.repos}
      />
    );
  }
}

export default App;
