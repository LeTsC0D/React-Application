three phases
Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.


Mounting
constructor()
getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()


Updating
getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()

Unmounting
componentWillUnmount()



PURE COMPONENTS
If the previous value of state or props and the new value of state or props is the 
same, the component will not re-render itself. Since Pure Components restricts the 
re-rendering when there is no use of re-rendering of the component. Pure Components 
are Class Components which extends React.PureComponent.

Create a counter app with increment decrement and capture button,
 when user click on increment count value increase by 1,
when you click on decrement count decrease by 1 and when 
you click on capture the current count would be added to 
list and we have to maintain list of captured value

Shubham Madheysia EASY REACT MOCK

Open https://codesandbox.io/s/new and create a new React component with 2 input fields, input1 and input2. Users can type any number in either of these input fields. You need to ensure that (input2 minus input1) is equal to 1 always. Means if user type value 5 in input1 then input2 value should change to 6 (to make input2 - input1 = 1). And similarly, if input2 value is 100 then input1 value should change to 99. You need to just play around with input values

Note: In the UI only 2 input fields should be present. No button needed.

Problem 2: Optimize ‘Problem 1’ by making it a stateless component. Means solve problem 1 without using any state variable. You still need to play with input tags and values only.

Note: Don’t write vanilla JS like document.getElementById etc. Use react hooks here.

PS: Keep Problem 1 and Problem 2 solutions separately. Don’t just work on Problem 2 because it is an optimization of Problem 1. Start with 1st alone

React componenets
Components are independent and reusable bits of code.

Four Kinds of React State
Local state	useState,useReducer
Global state	Context API,Redux 
manage state across multiple components,
Server state	useSWR
Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state.
What happens when there is a network error? 
Do I really need to hit my server every time my user visits the home page 
if the data hasn’t changed?
URL state	React Router ,useHistory or useLocation,useParams
information we need about our location, history, and pathname.
Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters.


useEffect
useEffect lets us perform side effects in function components
 It runs once our component mounts


useMemo allows us to 'memoize', or remember the result of expensive calculations 
const ans=useMemo(() => getLetterCount(word), [word])

useRef
allow us to create a reference to a given element / component when the component mounts

useReducer
Reducers are simple, predictable (pure) functions that take a previous state object 
and an action object and return a new state object

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "LOGIN":
      return { username: action.payload.username, isAuth: true };
    case "SIGNOUT":
      // could also spread in initialState here
      return { username: "", isAuth: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function App(){
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  function handleLogin() {
    dispatch({ type: "LOGIN", payload: { username: "Ted" } });
  }

  function handleSignout() {
    dispatch({ type: "SIGNOUT" });
  }

  return (
    <>
      Current user: {state.username}, isAuthenticated: {state.isAuth}
      <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
      <button onClick={handleSignout}>Signout</button>
    </>
  );
}


What is React
React is a JavaScript library, not a framework.

featues
JSX
components	create reusable behavior
React takes care of updating our UI when our data changes, 
without the need to update the DOM manually ourselves


pass data to React components
Props
Context API


React Fragments
React that let you write group children elements or components without 
creating an actual node in the DOM.


useCallback is to prevent functions that are declared within the body of function 
components from being recreated on every render.
useMemo, on the other hand, memoizes an expensive operation that we give it.


Higher order Component
higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.


fetch and axios
  const fetchData = () => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
      .then(response => {
        return response.json()
      })
      .then(data => {
        setUsers(data)
      })
  }

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
    const data = await response.json()
    setUsers(data)
  }


  const fetchData = () => {
    axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users").then(response => {
      setUsers(response.data)
    })
  }

    const postings = async () => {
        try{
            const res = await axios.get(url)
            setPosts(res.data.data)
        } catch (error) {
            console.log('error')
        }
    }

    const fetchData = async () => {
      const result = await axios(
        'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=redux',
      );
 
      setData(result.data);
    };


HOC

ROUTERS
Memory Router
Memory router keeps the URL changes in memory not in the user browsers. 

Browser Router
It routes as a normal URL in the browser and assumes that the server is handling all the request URL

Hash Router
Hash router uses client-side hash routing. 
It uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL
Whenever, there is a new route get rendered, it updated the browser URL with hash routes.


Pure Component
 Pure Component, there is no need for shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method. 
ReactJS Pure Component Class compares current state and props with new props and states to decide whether the React component should re-render itself or  Not.



React memo
export default memo(Todos);
Now the Todos component only re-renders when the todos that are passed 
to it through props are updated.
